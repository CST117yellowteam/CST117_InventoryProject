# CST117_InventoryProject - Yellow Team

This project is an inventory system designed for Grand Canyon Hardware to be used by management, the purchasing department, and store clerks.

# Milestone 2

Linda Lee - Our tasks for our Inventory project were to create a pseudocode and flow chart. They are important steps to describe the design of how the program will work to insure better inventory of items within the hardware store. In this milestone we all took part in researching on how each department will be utilizing the system. Flowcharts were hand drawn by Jose Fernandez. He also researched what type of symbols needed to be used in creating the flowchart. I used Word to create the flowcharts and many drafts were created until we agreed on using the one. Michael created all the pseudocode. This was definitely another learning experience to add to our building of our project.

Jose Fernandez - This week I worked on the top down design and the flowcharts. I made the top down design and after asking the instructor, Michael decided to make some changes and add it to the top down. I created the flowcharts for this week. Linda and Michael edited the flowcharts and made a few adjustments/updates. I did a drawing of the last flowchart during my military training, sent a picture of it through the group chat and Linda was able to put the drawing of the chart  on Microsoft Word and make some adjustments. Michael was able to the pseudocode, checked with us and we agreed on that it was good to go.

Michael Rogers - For Milestone 2, my primary focus was writing the pseudocode based on previously designed use cases and the flowcharts designed this week by Jose and Linda. Additionally, I provided some edits to the top down model design and flowcharts.
