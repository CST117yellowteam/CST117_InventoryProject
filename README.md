# CST117_InventoryProject - Yellow Team

This project is an inventory system designed for Grand Canyon Hardware to be used by management, the purchasing department, and store clerks.

# Milestone 2

Linda Lee - Our tasks for our Inventory project were to create a pseudocode and flow chart. They are important steps to describe the design of how the program will work to insure better inventory of items within the hardware store. In this milestone we all took part in researching on how each department will be utilizing the system. Flowcharts were hand drawn by Jose Fernandez. He also researched what type of symbols needed to be used in creating the flowchart. I used Word to create the flowcharts and many drafts were created until we agreed on using the one. Michael created all the pseudocode. This was definitely another learning experience to add to our building of our project.

Jose Fernandez - This week I worked on the top down design and the flowcharts. I made the top down design and after asking the instructor, Michael decided to make some changes and add it to the top down. I created the flowcharts for this week. Linda and Michael edited the flowcharts and made a few adjustments/updates. I did a drawing of the last flowchart during my military training, sent a picture of it through the group chat and Linda was able to put the drawing of the chart  on Microsoft Word and make some adjustments. Michael was able to the pseudocode, checked with us and we agreed on that it was good to go.

Michael Rogers - For Milestone 2, my primary focus was writing the pseudocode based on previously designed use cases and the flowcharts designed this week by Jose and Linda. Additionally, I provided some edits to the top down model design and flowcharts.

# Milestone 3

Linda Lee - In this weekâ€™s project I was introduced to using the Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) template. It gave me some time to learn about different features for each form created within the properties box. There are various styles, formats and color schemes to utilize to customize each form. I even got to play with the icon feature and found our logo for our project. We each created forms, the forms I worked on are Order, Alert and the Exit forms.

Jose Fernandez - this week, I used the file the Michael uploaded which had the initial login and main screen form. From there I added the forms for the search box, create new item, update quantity, check alerts and connected them to main screen. I worked on the style a little and then after linda and Michael made some other adjustments to it. 

Michael Rogers - This week, I worked on building the initial Login form, the main inventory form, and the edit item details form which was based on Linda's initial draft of the form. I also edited various forms to try and make sure our style remained consistent throughout the entire application.

# Milestone 4

Linda Lee - This week I learned that errors brought on by entering the wrong data could be a big problem in creating or updating an inventory database. There were so many scenarios we came up with as a team, we brainstormed and discussed what parts of the data in our forms a user could enter a wrong data type. After our discussion a list of what needs to happen when certain buttons are pressed was drawn up by Jose, and Michael did the coding. My contribution was just making a few suggestions and testing out the error messages by purposely entering wrong data and finally adding the beep feature.

Jose Fernandez - This week for milestone 4 I worked on creating the error list for each form of the software. After discussing it with the group, Michael was able to create the code for the needed error messages and after he verified with linda and myself and to see if it needed adjustments and we all agreed on it.

Michael Rogers - Wrote code to catch any errors that a user may input in the various data fields located throughout the application. Our application now rejects the incorrect input and displays a message to inform the user where the error occurred, and the correct format their input should be. Made adjustments after Linda's testing to assist in implementing her idea of additional means of alerting the user by using sound to signify an error has occurred.
